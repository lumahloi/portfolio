The goal was to develop a Chat Bot, I had no knowledge whatsoever of what goes on behind this application that is so essential in our daily lives. I immediately remembered that it was possible to use Telegram, WhatsApp and Discord as intermediaries, but I wanted to add a touch of visual identity that I particularly appreciate in a Chat Bot.

In this context, Fani was born, self-proclaimed FURIA's biggest fangirl. Her name is actually Stefani, because CS reminds me of "stealth" which I ended up using as a prefix, but not everyone needs to know that! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ People also commented that she looks like me, which is a total coincidence. Anyway, I thought it would be interesting to create a girl mascot as a way to highlight our presence in a more masculine environment.

I used TypeScript + React for the interface and Flask for the server. Although I was familiar with these languages, I didn't have a project using these frameworks yet, so I chose them. I couldn't find an API that could provide specific information, so I created my own database that was populated with information from the Liquipedia.net website. Luckily, this platform provides an API that returns the page content similar to a web scraping, so I just filtered the information.

Still, I needed an algorithm that would interpret the user's prompt and look for the answer in the most likely place among 9 different pages. After failed attempts at an algorithm, I realized that I needed real intelligence, so I applied the OpenAi API to solve these problems. This way, GPT can act as a Chat Bot and respond to even unrelated prompts, such as "what's your name?", "what's your goal?".

It was working perfectly locally, until I hosted the application on Vercel and Render and was haunted by a CORS error for almost 3 days ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ this part was the worst, I had to resort to a university student to directly analyze my code.

It was an enriching experience, I feel more experienced and above all, it was fun!

Have you ever had a stressful but enriching experience?
