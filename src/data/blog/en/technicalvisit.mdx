Last Tuesday (May 13th) we, students and faculty from **FAETERJ-Rio**, had the privilege of visiting **FAETERJ-Petr칩polis**.

We took a tour of the institution and got to know the **Santos Dumont's supercomputer**, which surprisingly is not even 100 meters away!

The college has jaw-dropping facilities:
- Networks Laboratory;
- Quantum Computing and Artificial Intelligence Hub;
- Common areas WITH VIDEO GAMES, ping-pong and television!!;
- Robotics Laboratory;
- Digital Media Laboratory, with a tripod for recording videos and equipment for producing podcasts;

- Computational Projects Laboratory;
- Applied Computational Mathematics Laboratory;
- a chair made from a payphone!;
- countless 3D printers accessible to students!!!

It was surprising to see the dedication and good management of the employees!

As for the supercomputer, I expected a monitor with a huge keyboard, connected to a blue terminal screen 游뱎游뱎

It was very interesting to see such cutting-edge technology up close. I was even more surprised when I discovered that there are researchers all over the world accessing it through the network, I thought it was only accessible in person.

Anyways, getting out of the academic routine was very refreshing! Thanks to everyone at the institution and at **FAETERJ-Rio**, especially to Professors **Maria Cl치udia Roenick**, **Cl치udio Bispo** and **Ros칙ngela Sena** who accompanied us.
