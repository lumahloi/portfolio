# Meowverse E-Commerce
**Meowverse** is a web store which sells figurines, leading the client through all customer experience and successfully makes checkouts. This project was my Final Paper for the Web Development Technician course I undertook, thus my first fullstack project. The modularization and project design isn't the best and will be fixed in the future, as well as code logic and refactoration.
